HTW3 coding class
Presentation avaliable on canvas, notes from presentation on onenote
Don't think this is a great one to do for the coursework - only got through 2 of 3 tasks. Not going to go back to the third at the moment. Spent most of the session trying to understand what the code did. Tbh my main takeaway was that it doens't hurt to stick all the code into chatgpt to understand it and comment it before making any changes.
